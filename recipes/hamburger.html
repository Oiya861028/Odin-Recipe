    A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of a patty of ground beef served within 
    a split bread roll, with various garnishes such as lettuce, onion, tomato, 
    and sliced cucumber pickle, along with condiments like mustard, mayonnaise, 
    ketchup and other saucesÂ¹. The patty itself is often seasoned or augmented 
    with chopped onions, spices or bread crumbs before cooking. A slice of cheese 
    is melted over the patty in the variation known as the cheeseburger.
